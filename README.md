-WHAT THIS IS

If you are seeing this README.md then you have checked out
the ezsammy_package_for_arduino

To fullfill its purpose this file and project should be

-HOW TO USE

This WIP adds a SAM-E70 board to the Arduino IDE

Check it out into the ~/.arduino<rev>/packages directory

It will overwrite these files:
~/.arduino<rev>/packages/arduino/hardware/samd/1.8.11/boards.txt
~/.arduino<rev>/packages/arduino/hardware/samd/1.8.11/platform.txt

so back them up first if you want them (you do)

It will also add these files:
~/.arduino<rev>/packages/arduino/hardware/samd/1.8.11/variants/ezsammy
